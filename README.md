## About

**My3DWebsite** is a car game that allows you to control a car in a 3D environment. The game utilizes **Three.js** for rendering 3D models and **custom physics** to simulate real-world car behavior. The carâ€™s movement includes:
- **Acceleration**
- **Braking**
- **Ground interaction** (car is "stuck" to the ground to simulate real-world physics)

The game provides a smooth experience with realistic car mechanics, and you can enjoy exploring the environment and driving the car.

## Features
- 3D environment with car model.
- Custom physics engine for car movement (acceleration, brakes).
- Realistic ground interaction (car sticks to the ground).
- Playable in your browser using Three.js.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (Recommended version: 14 or higher)
- **npm install requiremets.txt** (Node package manager)

### Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yasir027/my3dwebsite.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd my3dwebsite
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install requirements.txt
```

4. Start the local development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Your project should now be running locally at `http://localhost:3000`. Open this in your browser to play the game.

### Step-by-Step Guide

In the `step-by-step-guide` folder, you will find detailed instructions on how to set up and implement each feature of the game. You can follow this guide to understand the code in each folder and module. The steps include:

- Setting up **Three.js** for 3D rendering.
- Implementing **Physics** to simulate car acceleration, braking, and friction with the ground.
- Adding **Car Model** and setting it up in the scene.
- Handling **Car Controls** (keyboard or joystick input).
- Detailed explanations and code snippets that you can **copy-paste** into the official components folder within `src/`.

## How to Play

Once the game is running in your browser, use the following controls:

- **W** - Accelerate the car.
- **S** - Brake the car.
- **A** - Steer left.
- **D** - Steer right.

Feel free to explore the 3D environment and try out different driving maneuvers. The game will continue to evolve, and more features may be added in the future!
